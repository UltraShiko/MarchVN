        Scholars are uncertain of how Eldermyst came to be. Many priests believed that it was formed by Yeshua or the other deities. Arcanists speculate that a magical collision brought the plane into existence. And the wacky Tu'uns will tell you that the mortals are the outsiders, not them. Regardless, the world finds itself at the center between the forces of Good-aligned Heaven, and the evil-aligned Hell. Both forces impact the mortals that live here.

        Eldermyst is a vast plane with civilizations and cultures popping up in even its most dangerous lands. Cartographers have categorized each of its continents as follows:

        The Holy Lands

        Jorunderfell

        Skyfold

        Elmyra

        Meropia

        The Badlands

        The Holy Lands are to the south of the plane. Biomes, cold and hot, can be found in this continent, with its neighbor, Jorunderfell, being covered in swamps and ice. They are referred to as the Holy Lands because its capital, Constantania, was where the Celestials and Exorcists were founded.

        Many speculate that these lands are the hunting grounds for Devils. There is no proof, but the Celestials are always hard at work with hunting them. Meanwhile the Exorcists shun all of the divine. They strive for independence from gods and other empires, and forbid anyone from seeking any divine aid. This creates an interesting schism; with the Celestials embracing the divine and shunning the arcane, and vice versa. This rivalry not only shapes the cultures, but also the land it resides on. Dominions occupied by the Celestials are more hospitable, sacred, and welcoming whilst the dark cities of the Exorcists are gothic, cruel, and ruled by fear.

        Jubilee is a hustling trading center, known as the marketplace of the continent alongside the capital Constatantania. It is also the city where the kingdom's ruling reverend has resided throughout generations.

        Jubilee serves as a haven for refugees, aspiring merchants, and adventurers. Depending on the reverend in power, it might also serve as a sanctuary for outcasts, such as the dretchlings, or a place to garrison armies such as the Celestials. The trading city has taken many forms as its reverend engineered its construction.

        While it is not as big as Constantania, that does not exonerate it from problems. Cults of various archfiends litter the outskirts, evading detection by even the reverend himself...

        The Hale bloodline has controlled the Holy Lands for generations. Ever since Reverend Hale I founded the Celestials with his divine mastery, to Reverend Hale II's establishment of the empire that stands today, these scions rule unopposed and shall remain unopposed for generations.

        Due to their founder's mastery of the rare mana, Justice, these scions are believed to have a divine lineage to Yeshua. The Hales are famous for performing miracles, banishing devils, and other feats that draw pilgrimages to the city of Jubilee.

        Currently, Reverend Hale III carries the torch. While his reign is founded on fear, many accept it due to Reverend Hale II's authoritative regime.

        """{=compendium_screen_title_style}Celestials, the Knights of Heaven{/compendium_screen_title_style}

        Known as the guardians of Eldermyst from the forces of Hell, these warriors seek to promote order and security throughout the land. Channeling the might of Yeshua, or gods with a similar portfolio, the Celestials use might and magic to defend the weak, aid the sick, and ward off corruption.

        These holy knights come in many shapes and sizes. Most of them take up the mantle of guards, and others focus more on their attunement to Mana. Some might even serve as scouts, spies, and even assassins to ensure that peace is kept. However their tenets are resolute, and all Celestials must be mindful of how they conduct themselves. Being closely tied to the gods of good means that their actions are always under scrutiny. Whether it be from an archon, or their superiors, being a Celestial takes a lot of discipline and humility.

        One must remember that Celestials are mortal just like everyone else. This code of conduct has not kept every knight in check. Many devils delight in corrupting these clerics, morphing them into blackguards to serve Hell's forces. Many fiends consider these souls a delicacy to be harvested. As Celestials hunt devils, they too are being hunted. This wicked game of Cat and Mouse has driven many Celestials into paranoia; leading to punishments that rarely fit the crime. Dretchlings are especially susceptible to this mistreatment, and many Celestials have called for these poor souls to be confined and even executed for the good of all.

        All Celestials follow a hierarchy. The more heroic a Celestial is, the more likely they are to be promoted. This ceremony is not only led by mortals, but the gods themselves. It is not a man who decides that one should attain higher status but a messenger from Heaven itself. But these come with a test. A Celestial who wishes to become a Legate might be asked to lead a band of refugees to sanctuary. A Legate who wishes to become a Warden must develop a shrewdness for not just selflessness, but economics themselves. And a Warden who wishes to become a Reverend must be approved by Yeshua himself.

        Celestials carry burdens that are heavier than any armor they may don, but they are humanity's staunchest defenders. When a portal opens and all hell breaks loose, they will be at the forefront, ready to defend their realm.

        """{=compendium_screen_title_style}Meropia, the Utopia under the Sea{/compendium_screen_title_style}

        Meropia is a kingdom enraptured in mystique. It is a kingdom with no set location or factual information backing it's existence. The only proof of this mysterious city is the Meropians, who are often unsure of its existence as well. They say that this is where they originate from, but many Meropians have yet to see their home for themselves.

        Sightings of this kingdom are just as erratic as the rumors behind. Many believe it's at the bottom of the ocean, while other adventures claim to have found it in a bayou of all places. Meropians are unlikely to confide information about Meropia and if they do, it is often dubious at best. Many tales have depicted armies from the kingdom appearing on Dolphins, Orca Whales, and various sea creatures to smite the foolhardy mortals that provoked the ocean. Many a scholar might speak such tales to dissuade pollution, or even to persuade invaders who have to cross an ocean to get to their lands..

        The agreed upon name for its king is Merus. Just like his hold, King Merus is shrouded in mystery. Many believe he is an ancient wyrm that is worshipped like Yggdravundr, and others claim he is an archmage who has discovered immortality. Many skeptics, namely the zealous naysayers, claim that he dabbled with devils or other dark forces to obtain his power. Most Meropians wouldn't know.

        Meropians; often dubbed Mermaids or Mermen, hail from the Coral Kingdom of Meropia. This race of mortals rarely surfaces from their haven, wishing to keep their societies separated from everyone else; and for good reason. Treasure Hunters, zealous crusades, and curiosity have caused friction between the Merfolk and the other races on numerous occasions.

        What sets a meropian apart, aside from their tails, are their scales littered about their humanoid torso. Some are more bestial, sporting webbed ears or dorsal fins on their back. With Meropians being nomadic, one Meropian can look completely different from another. Meropia is the only kingdom where armies gather. The ocean is littered with predators and other nefarious enemies, so it's best to keep schools small and mobile. Sometimes different schools combine or disperse based upon the needs of the people. Meropians tend to be friendly to foreign tribes, however it is not unheard of skirmishes to start. But no Meropian would dare strike out against Meropia. And with Meropians being so spread out, any body of water is liable to have a Meropian or two slithering around its banks. And this wonderlust is often what puts them in danger...

        Whilst Meropians prefer to keep to themselves, trade still occurs. Trinkets crafted from coral, fish, and Meropian handiwork are very popular with sailors and towns that make their living off of the coastline. Meropians trust these smaller towns above any kingdoms they fall under. Villagers tend to be more honest and keep their word, seeing as they often need these products to survive. And Meropians do take delight in studying and collecting trinkets of the land. Some Meropians learn the magic needed to transform, and act ambassadors for other schools or Meropia. But that will not make the Meropians hesitate to seek vengeance unto these villagers if they take advantage of these alliances. Unfortunately, while these magicians may make friends with other races, many of them are shunned by their own communities...

        Often believed to be the first humans who walked Eldermyst, these titanic mortals stand as the strongest race. They stand at a whopping eight feet on average, and are believed to have the strength to move mountains.

        But their strength and origins have not shielded them from oppression. Many zealous mortals believe that the Nephillim abandoned their creator and took to cannibalism and brutality. The races exempt from Yeshua's lore sees them as monsters, brigands, and sometimes, spies sent from Yeshua to subjugate the plane.

        These people were driven to the moutains of Skyfold. Their strength served them well in those rugged conditions, and some believe that they worship dragons. These harsh lands serve as a refuge, for many adventurers have perished trying to explore the tundras. And even if they survived, legend has it that one of the Dragon Lords rests atop the peak.

        When someone wields mana for purposes other than themselves, Grace is likely to be wielded. This mana is often associated with healers, triumph over evil, and even the angels themselves. Few are able to wield it, and those that do draw a lot of awe from others around them.

        Grace functions differently from other forms of mana. Its strengths are found through its healing and blessing capabilities. It can be used to fortify one's constitution, alongside relieving fear or other mental maladies. Stronger wielders can break curses or undo corrupt transformations.

        However, Grace bestows no other strength. Blows powered by Grace are no stronger than without. If anything, Grace ensures that an attack doesn't kill. Though it does a good job at bolstering one's endurance and numbing pain, it is not a mana wielded by those who wish to become stronger but by those who wish to protect the ones they care about.

        Grace's aura is a icy blue.

        There is little that isn't inherently evil about Malice. It is a variant of mana that has been distorted and twisted by pride and hatred. Most of the evil connotations surrounding Sin aren't based around the mana itself, but the potential for it to morph into Malice.

        The techniques and ambitions fueled by Malice seek not just to destroy one's enemy, but to conquer. Whilst one who channels other types of mana would focus on victory, Malice's wielder would wish to strike fear, pain, and despair into their foes. Victory is still the objective, but the more pain one inflicts, the stronger Malice becomes.

        There is little that isn't inherently evil about Malice. It is a variant of mana that has been distorted and twisted by selfishness and a hatred for all that oppose its wielder. Most of the evil connotations surrounding Sin aren't based around the mana itself, but the potential for it to morph into Malice.

Victory is still the objective, but the more pain one inflicts, the stronger Malice becomes.

        It's rare for someone to wield Malice by accident. It might start out as someone wanting one thing, such as vengeance, with their intent become more malevolent and selfish. Trauma, strife, and injustices are the prime contributors to Malice's use. Sometimes people wield Malice as a boon from a devil's contract, and the fiend-blooded dretchlings have an innate attraction to the wicked mana. The pitiful race often falls to Malice not because of their birthright, but because of the people that fear and despise them.

        While people who channel Malice have evil intent, that isn't to say that they can't fit into society. Malice might not be directed at the world, just a portion of it. Those who channel Malice can still love others, have friends, and have a moral compass. But what makes them use Malice is the ruthless endeavors they're willing to undertake to achieve their goals, caring not for anyone's well-being but themselves.

        "Tu'uns, Wanderers of the Veil",
        """{=compendium_screen_title_style}Tu'uns, Wanderers of the Veil{/compendium_screen_title_style}

        A Tu'un is a spirit that can take many forms. Unlike the Primordials, such as the Archons or Devils, Tu'uns are native to the plane of Eldermyst. These entities are often credited as the ancestors of races such as Brawnies, Pigmies, Wrackies, Meropians, and other mortals with a peculiar appearance.

        Tu'uns do not operate under the same principles as good or evil. A Tu'un is interested in self indulgence, and nothing else. This doesn't make them adversaries by design. A Tu'un can be pleasant or very unplesant based upon it's nature and how it is respected. Many spellcasters that serve as wardens of the plane form alliances with these whimiscal creatures, and are often called upon to serve as mediators if a dispute arises.

        What sets a Tu'un apart any other being is its inability to follow rules. Not only does this hint towards their chaotic nature, but also to their existence as a whole. Say you encountered a Tu'un that took the form of a talking pigeon. Imagine your face when you see said pigeon demonstrate the strength of a giant! Or perhaps you may encounter an elephant who can't lift a fimble but be quicker than most creatures half it's size. The only thing "consistent" about Tu'uns is that while they excel at something, they are liable to be hopeless incompetent at another ability. Most are unlikely to learn a Tu'un's abilities until it is too late, so they should be approached with caution.

        Tu'uns originate from a phenomenon known as the Veil, an alternate Eldermyst the coexists as a mirror version of the plane. Some speculate that this was Eldermyst's original form before the Primordials discovered it. Some claim that the Tu'uns constructed it to get away from the angels and zealous mortals trying to wipe them out. Everyone claims that they'd sooner visit Hell than that mad dimension. Various continents of the plane might have a strong, or nonexistent attraction to the Veil. While Tu;uns are very rare in the Holy Lands, the upper cities of Elmyra have cultures integrated with these creatures.

        Czartu'uns are legendary Tu'uns that are worshipped like other pantheons. They are quick to reward any who make offerings to them, but easily provoked. One can find themselves blessed and cursed within the same day for whatever reason. This unpredictability makes their worship rare, but their quick rewards prevent it from dying out.

        All Czartu'uns make their domains related to facets of mortality. Titania takes dominion over life, birth, spring, and the sun, whilst Oberon takes dominion over death, winter, and the moon. These domains however, are not so easily followed. Titania loathes intermixing of races, and Oberon finds most healers offensive to behold. While their worship is often founded on gratification, many offerings are made for the sole purpose of the Czartu'uns leaving them alone.

        """{=compendium_screen_title_style}Hecate, the Matron Archfiend{/compendium_screen_title_style}

        When one thinks of an archfiend, the last thing they consider is a woman of virtue. Lady Hecate embodies many aspects of desire. From a beautiful woman, to security of one's family, and to the beauty of children, all symbolize the archfiend's grace.

        Hecate is a dangerous archfiend. She does not bind mortals through temptation, coercion, or seduction. Rather, she is simply present. Many turn to Yeshua for guidance and find nothing more than vagueness and uncertainty, the task being for them to answer as he supposedly guides the mortal to their solution. Hecate is no such being. She is notorious for answering calls more than any archfiend. Whether through her agents, or the destruction of one's enemies, she includes herself into the lives of her followers. But with a price.

        Like any devil, Hecate asks for the signing of pacts. Unlike other devils, it is not her pacts that bind the soul but the devotion that leads the soul to her. Hecate's deals are fair and vague only in extremities. In tandem with their request, the mortal will find themselves with more than they bargained for. The succubi and incubi that serve her often become evangelizers to the mortal, slowly indoctrinating them into her flock through their wisdom and their reliability. Eventually the mortal views her as their patron, and follow her decrees blindly despite how bloody they might be. For Mother knows best, and those that spited her will spite anyone else they come by.

        Hecate is a benevolent archfiend, but also holds the domain of vengeance. It is true that all archfiends are monsters. They'd gladly conquer Eldermyst had it not been for the Tu'uns and Archons that defend it, but Hecate fears no one. She does not ravage the lands of transgressor. She prefers irony and inflicting despair as one's greatest wish is twisted against them. They say that when rosebushes surround an area, Hecate's wrath is near. And many conquerors, soldiers, or even defenders refuse to attack children or their mothers because doing so is believed to summon the end of your existence.
