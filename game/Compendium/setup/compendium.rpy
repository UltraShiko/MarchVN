Scholars are uncertain of how Eldermyst came to be. Many priests believed that it was formed by Yeshua or the other deities. Arcanists speculate that a magical collision brought the plane into existence. And the wacky Tu'uns will tell you that the mortals are the outsiders, not them. Regardless, the world finds itself at the center between the forces of good-aligned Heaven, and the evil-aligned Hell. Both forces impact the mortals that live here.

Eldermyst is a vast plane with civilizations and cultures popping up in even its most dangerous lands. Cartographers have categorized each of its continents as follows:

The Holy Lands

Jorunderfell

Skyfold

Elmyra

Meropia

The Badlands

The Ratscallion Enterprise

The Holy Lands are to the south of the plane. Biomes, cold and hot, can be found in this continent, with its neighbor, Jorunderfell, being covered in swamps and ice. They are referred to as the Holy Lands because its capital, Constantania, was where the Celestials and Exorcists were founded.

Many speculate that these lands are the hunting grounds for Devils. There is no proof, but the Celestials are always hard at work with hunting them. Meanwhile the Exorcists shun all of the divine. They strive for independence from gods and other empires, and forbid anyone from seeking any divine aid. In their eyes, mortals are capable of not only independence, but even surpassing the gods themselves. After all, the races native to the plane of Eldermyst (Brawnies, Pigmies, Wrackies, and so forth) flourished without their influence for millenia.

This creates an interesting schism; with the Celestials embracing the divine and shunning the arcane, and vice versa. This rivalry not only shapes the cultures, but also the land it resides on. Dominions occupied by the Celestials are more hospitable, sacred, and welcoming whilst the dark cities of the Exorcists are gothic, cruel, and ruled by fear.

For generations, the lands were united under one ruler; Reverend Hale. It is said that this man was chosen by Yeshua himself, using magic from Heaven itself to leads his troops against the Thrycians. His predecessor forged the Celestial empire into what it is, and it wasn't until Reverend Hale III's demise that the empire split into separate factions. After the Calamity known as the Reckoning, the secular Exorcists were formed.

An uneasy peace exists between both factions, and scholars are constantly speculating of when war will break out. Some fear that the spark of violence will trigger another reckoning, while others believe that the empire is doomed to invasion from it's neighbor, Jorunderfell. Only time will tell...

Jubilee is a hustling trading center, seen as the marketplace of the continent alongside the capital Constatantania. It is also the city where the kingdom's ruling reverend has resided throughout generations.

Jubilee serves as a haven for refugees, aspiring merchants, and adventurers. Depending on the reverend in power, it might also serve as a sanctuary for outcasts, such as the Dretchlings, or a place to garrison armies such as the Celestials. The trading city has taken many forms as its reverend engineered its construction.

The city's crown attraction is the Luminous Tower, a massive building of architecture ingenuity. The building was not forged from stone, wood, brick, or anything other than glass! No one is certain of how, but the stalwart building has been the resting place for the reverend for generations.

Despite being under the reverend's command, this city is not free from strife. Crime is always an issue, and after the Reckoning, the Emissaries have been weeding out Hecate's cultists like lice in hair. Many shadow wars have been fought within Jubilee's sanctum, but the new Reverend Hale IV has promised his citizens protection if a second reckoning occurs.

Being the remnants of an empire as old as time, Thrycia is a shell of its former self. The city carries an ancient tradition. Unlike most settlements, Thrycia worships no deity. It's been an empire infamous for its violent and hedonistic ways.

It is said that Thrycia survived the wrath of Yeshua. Many priests believe that Yeshua once turned his armies onto the sinful empire. Back when Eldermyst was unexplored and when the angels and devils became divided, many believe that the citizens of Thrycia took to breeding with the outcasts of Heaven. It is speculated that Cambions and Dretchlings were first sired here, and that had it not been for the Archfiend Hecate, Thrycia would be nothing but ash.

The capital feature of Thrycia is its colosseum. Many come to speculate gladiators fighting for fame, or Hunters going toe-to-toe against whatever monstrosity the tamers could wrangle up. Thrycia was the empire to commercialize violence, and is the only hold in the The Holy Lands that is allowed to host such sport, as long as they keep the ferocity to a minimum.

Thrycia is ruled by an Emperor. To behold such a title involves not royal blood, but feats of skill, leadership, and the fame of the crowd. The nobility of Thrycia is earned in the arena, through military service, and so on. However the toll these challenges inflict is too much for many. Merchants and farmers much prefer a comfortable life to one forged with steel and blood. While royalty is open to the public, few dare to meet its challenge.

The Celestials, after conquering most of Thrycia's ancient dominion, allowed the capital to retain not only its culture, but also its own government in exchange for trade and Thrycian soldiers. Many are unsure as to why, with the most believed reason being that Thrycian warfare is respected almost as much as Yeshua. However the Exorcists from the Babelonian Theocracy find the old kingdom a stain. And had tensions between the Celestials and the Exorcists not been so dismal, they just might've made an attempt on the Emperor's life.

Due to their founder's mastery of the rare mana, Justice, these scions are believed to have a divine lineage to Yeshua. The Hales are famous for performing miracles, banishing devils, and other feats that draw pilgrimages to the city of Jubilee.

Currently, Reverend Hale IV carries the torch. His stern, but compassonate rulership has drawn much favor from the public. Unlike his uncle, he seeks to break the cycle of hatred and fear from his subjects. But with the Reckoning still fresh on people's minds, such a task is a tall order to ask...

Known as the guardians of Eldermyst from the forces of Hell, these warriors seek to promote order and security throughout the land. Channeling the might of Yeshua, or gods with a similar portfolio, the Celestials use might and magic to defend the weak, aid the sick, and ward off corruption.

These holy knights come in many shapes and sizes. Most of them take up the mantle of guards, and others focus more on their attunement to Mana. Some might even serve as scouts, spies, and even assassins to ensure that peace is kept. However their tenets are resolute, and all Celestials must be mindful of how they conduct themselves. Being closely tied to the gods of good means that their actions are always under scrutiny. Whether it be from an archon, or their superiors, being a Celestial takes a lot of discipline and humility.

One must remember that Celestials are mortal just like everyone else. This code of conduct has not kept every knight in check. Many devils delight in corrupting these clerics, morphing them into blackguards to serve Hell's forces. Many fiends consider these souls a delicacy to be harvested. As Celestials hunt devils, they too are being hunted. This wicked game of Cat and Mouse has driven many Celestials into paranoia; leading to punishments that rarely fit the crime. Dretchlings are especially susceptible to this mistreatment, and many Celestials have called for these poor souls to be confined and even executed for the good of all.

All Celestials follow a hierarchy. The more heroic a Celestial is, the more likely they are to be promoted. This ceremony is not only led by mortals, but the gods themselves. It is not a man who decides that one should attain higher status but a messenger from Heaven itself. But these come with a test. A Celestial who wishes to become a Legate might be asked to lead a band of refugees to sanctuary. A Legate who wishes to become a Warden must develop a shrewdness for not just selflessness, but economics themselves. And a Warden who wishes to become a Reverend must be approved by Yeshua himself.

However, ever since the Reckoning, these warriors have been in short supply. Many Celestials abandoned their faith, and many that remain have taken to paranoia, cruelty, or the law into their own hands. While Reverend Hale has tried to encourage his subjects to be the change people need, many cling to the old customs of his forefathers; arresting anyone they deem suspicious, namely Dretchlings

Celestials carry burdens that are heavier than any armor they may don, but they are humanity's staunchest defenders. When a portal opens and all hell breaks loose, they will be at the forefront, ready to defend their realm.

A dark sect of the Celestials, the Emissaries are a mysterious band of rogues that specialize in espionage and the execution.

When this band was founded, the Emissaries were originally tasked with infiltrating other nations, and dispatching of spies. As Reverend Hale II came into power, their goals shifted to extraplanar affairs. With Celestia a now established empire, people feared the influence and potential invasions from devils. As of the Reckoning, this group has all but abandoned political affairs in favor of hunting devils and their acolytes.

The Emissaries do not strive to protect others, well not as much as the Celestials. They strike fear into the hearts of citizens, and have no qualms with torturing those they capture. This dark outlook isn't mandatory, just a byproduct of the horrors these agents endure.

In the hierarchy, Emissaries do not hold much power but are respected and left to their own devices. A budding Celestial is allowed to become one, and many seek the title as a test of faith and themselves. More reserved Celestials enjoy the role's exclusion from the public, and many flocked the position in hopes of preventing another divine calamity. However this profession is not trusted by the more idealistic knights, and some have called for its often cruel procedures.

The Emisaries were founded under the Archlord Ahriman, the Guiding Star. Many have his upside down symbol pinned somewhere on their clothing to symbolize his impending judgement. Though this faith varies from person to person, and worship of this Archlord is not enforced, just his more, "extreme" idealogies...

Many who enter the organization leave with broken spirits or in a coffin. Those that survive earn a begrudging respect from both ally and enemy alike. And with their cold determination, even devils are wary of them

Often referred to as Thorns, this notorious cult of Hecate is often just as elusive as the Archfiend herself.

What does one think of when they hear cultist? A man in dark robes leading a sacrifice? Or a person calling upon dark powers? These depictions are how the Thorns hope you perceive them, for what makes this sect so infamous is their ability to blend in. Almost anyone could be a Thorn, from a beggar to a smith to a guard and even a priest of Yeshua!

Hecate does not aspire her followers to be cruel or bloodthirsty. With her pension for children, orphanages required supervision because of how often the mothers were caught worshiping her. Roses of all colors are forbidden for their similarity to Hecate's symbology. Kukris are banned for similar reasons, and the color purple now draws suspicion from nobles rather than admiration.

With all of this in mind, there are rituals and asttire involved in her worship. These aren't mandatory in this cult, and those that defy the law hold much respect from their colleagues. Many shadow wars have been fought between these cultists and Emissaries, and her worship is especially dangerous with the penalties being extraordinarily severe. Many people have been wrongfully accused of worshiping Hecate ever since the Reckoning, and only Reverend Hale IV himself can save them...

Before Reverend Hale IV succeed his uncle, a divine tragedy known as the Reckoning occurred. Unlike his forefathers, the current reverend ascended not through ceremony, but blood.

Twenty years ago, in the city of Jubilee, disaster struck. They say the sky tore itself open, and devils rained down like a heavy storm. Those that witnessed it still have nightmares of its horrors. Celestials, the sentinels of mankind, were butchered, abducted, and Yeshua knows what else the fiends came up with. Many a Paladin fell that day, and those that didn't retired not just their profession, but their affiliation with the Archons. Despite the mass destruction, not a single archon came to their aid. Especially not to Reverend Hale III, who witnesses claimed, was dragged into the void, screaming, by a female devil now known as the Banshee of Jubilee.‌

People speculate the reason behind the attack. Many believe that Reverend Hale III's tyranny drew the ire of an archfiend. The reverend burned many "witches", and was quick to dish out punishment at even the slightest offense.

The Reckoning did more thn just slay the reverend. Reverend Hale III was despised by the other barons of the Holy Lands. His damnation led to the opportunistic nobles to denouncing the next reverend as their ruler. Many Celestials broke their vows that day as well. Many civilians believed that Yeshua was punishing them, but the broken knights came to a worse conclusion; that the Archlords cared little for mortals.

Dretchlings are considered the outcasts of Eldermyst. Being the descendants devils, these wretched beings struggle just to exist. There are few sanctuaries that willingly house this species of man, for their bloodline alone brands them as undesirable by most.

While Dretchlings inherited the blood of devils, their creation isn't as simple as a mortal breeding with a fiend. The product of this unholy union is known as a Cambion; a dretchling with a stronger link to their infernal ancestry.

This cambion's offspring is where the dretchling babe comes into play. However, rumors speculate that the Succubi serving under the archfiend Hecate produce dretchling children instead of cambions. And seeing as how succubi are notorious for seducing man, it is accepted as fact by most scholars.

Dretchlings can also be the result of a curse. A common penalty of unfulfilled contracts with devils curses one's bloodline to produce dretchlings. This is the preferred punishment for most devils. While they could lay claim to the soul of the transgressor, it is seen as more lucrative to allow the fool to live their life and bear children; children that'll be easier to deceive and corrupt.

Dretchlings have free will just like other mortals. While their bloodlines link them to Hell, it is not unheard of for a dretchling to disown this connection and distance themselves from it as much as possible. However, mortals are often their worst enemies. Many dretchlings that fall to Hell's influence have been beaten and broken by the people that demonize them. Devils flock to them not because of their blood, they flock to them because many are forced into desperate circumstances by their own neighbors.

Hecate's followers are known for \"adopting\" these downtrodden souls and forging them into vengeful champions and protectors of their brethren. Other archfiends prefer a fatalistic approach to enlisting them; convincing them that their fates were decided the moment their heartless matrons that gave birth to them.

With how much the cards are stacked against these people, many wonder how most survive. Crimes against a dretchling are met with slaps on the wrist, with the reverse being met with crueler penalties. The most common speculation is fear. It is a well known fact that attacking children or their mothers is seen as unforgivable to Hecate, who has a history of avenging these injustices directly. Others see them as unstable, liable to lash out or to consult with devils to retaliate. Dretchlings can be intimidating by their features alone.

It is difficult to converse with someone who has horns protruding from their head after all. Governments might make policies to protect them, whilst others might seek to exclude the race to camps or banish them entirely. Though whilst fear is a strong deterrent, dretchlings are still the most victimized ancestry of mortals.

Meropians, often dubbed Mermaids or Mermen, hail from the Coral Kingdom of Meropia. This race of mortals rarely surfaces from their haven, wishing to keep their societies separated from everyone else; and for good reason. Treasure Hunters, zealous crusades, and curiosity have caused friction between the Merfolk and the other races on numerous occasions.

What sets a meropian apart, aside from their tails, are their scales littered about their humanoid torso. Some are more bestial, sporting webbed ears or dorsal fins on their back. With Meropians being nomadic, one Meropian can look completely different from another. Meropia is the only kingdom where armies gather. The ocean is littered with predators and other nefarious enemies, so it's best to keep schools small and mobile. Sometimes different schools combine or disperse based upon the needs of the people. Meropians tend to be friendly to foreign tribes, however it is not unheard of skirmishes to start. But no Meropian would dare strike out against Meropia. And with Meropians being so spread out, any body of water is liable to have a Meropian or two slithering around its banks. And this wanderlust is often what puts them in danger...

Whilst Meropians prefer to keep to themselves, trade still occurs. Trinkets crafted from coral, fish, and Meropian handiwork are very popular with sailors and towns that make their living off of the coastline. Meropians trust these smaller towns above any kingdoms fall under. Villagers tend to be more honest and keep their word, seeing as they often need these products to survive. And meropians do take delight in studying and collecting trinkets of the land. Some Meropians learn the magic needed to transform, and act ambassadors for other schools or Meropia. But that will not make the Meropians hesitate to seek vengeance unto these villagers if they take advantage of these alliances. Unfortunately, while these magicians befriend other races, many of them are shunned by their own communities...

It is believed that the Reckoning might've been caused by a Meropian. Five years prior, Reverend Hale III executed a Meropian who had allied herself with the Archfiend Hecate in exchange for being transformed into a human. They say that she schemed to assassinate the reverend, and many believe that she fell in love with a human. What is certain was the chilling speech she spoke before she was burnt at the stake.

Some say she called for the Archfiend herself, some claim she had gone mad and embraced her death with a smile, and others believed that she swore vengeance: a common threat made by many of Hecate's followers.

Jinx - a curse or handicap inflicted on an individual at birth, believed to be by a Tu'un or malevolent entity.

Jinxes can come in all shapes and sizes. Some are more visible, like stagnated height or uneven limbs, while others are harder to spot. It is unclear why these beings jinx babes, and some are uncertain if these afflictions aren't better explained by biological causes.

The way jinxed individuals are treated is largely basd upon the nature of the curse. Fear of the Archfiend Hecate has discouraged the disposal of afflicted children, and many flock to the assistance of a jinxed person assuming they are good natured. However some jinxes are much less civilized, and force a victim to behave in manner that is beyond sympathy. 

Hence, many have been researching cures for these hexes. Some have consulted with Tu;uns, but to varying results. Some jnxes have been cured with magic, while others demand certain items or rituals be undertaken to keep symptoms at bay. The only method that will cure a jinx permanently is a deal with a fiend, at the low cost of the victim's soul.

        "Mana - the Essence of Resolve",
        """{=compendium_screen_title_style}Mana - The Essence{/compendium_screen_title_style}

Mana is a spiritual energy found in all beings. It is primarily channeled into making one’s ideals become reality, whether it be the achievement of a dream, maintaining order and goodwill, the destruction of one's foes, etc. For example, a farmer might find his energy nigh limitless when determined to make a profit. A merchant who is desperate to make ends meet or to acquire an expensive item might find his tongue silvered more so than before. The hymns, songs, stories, and art created from the passions of its founders.

The layperson's use of mana is not as empowering as the person might believe. "Nigh limitless energy" is a minor expression of one's mana. While there is indeed a boost, a lot of mana's empowering effects need to be practiced and channeled. A lot of the "legendary" effects to the layperson are simply one's personal resolve. That said, Mana can and will push one to perform feats comparable to the gods themselves with enough training and determination.

When channeled, Mana becomes an important component to everyone in combat. Often viewed as the manifestation of willpower, mana can grant a number of abilities. Priests can channel mana to heal the sick, mages channel mana to hurl their spells, warriors channel mana to perform deeds in combat, and so on. One's mana capabilities are reliant on their wielder's mental constitution. Just as it takes energy to swing an ax, it takes focus and resolve to see that it strikes true. When one believes that their life is in jeopardy, a concoction of mana and adrenaline grant every cornered rat the will to fight. However mana is not limitless.

The most rudimentary way one can describe Mana's capacity is to compare it to your favorite pasttime. Perhaps you enjoy tending to the animals every day. You start out fixated on playing with them, until eventually you opt to head inside and find something else to do. However if you were forced to only play with the animals ad nauseum, you might become bored. Hell you may devolve into hating the farm activity as a whole. This decline is often called Compassion Fatigue. Mana is the same. It grows harder to channel once someone's limit is reached, and overuse can result in injury; both physical and mental. Dubbed burnout, this exhaustion is a common manifestation of mana overuse.

There are many theories behind the origins of Mana. The faithful believe that it was a gift from the gods to equip their faithful. Secular practitioners believe that it is a cosmological effect of the differing planes on its inhabitants. Some believe it is the essence of one's soul, noted by the physical deterioration one expends too much mana.

Regardless of origin, it takes a lot of physical, mental, and spiritual training to properly wield Mana. One's emotions can influence both the type of mana conjured, and its intensity. Improper use can lead to disaster; both on the individual and those around them,

There are four known forms of Mana:

- Sin

- Grace

- Justice

- Malice

        """{=compendium_screen_title_style}Grace, the Mana of Goodwill{/compendium_screen_title_style}

When someone wields mana for purposes other than themselves, Grace is likely the result. This mana is often associated with healers, forbearance, and even the archons themselves. Few are able to wield it, and those that do draw a lot of awe from others around them.

Grace functions differently from other forms of mana. Its strengths are found through its healing and blessing capabilities. It can be used to fortify one's constitution, alongside relieving fear or other mental maladies. Stronger wielders can break curses or undo corrupt transformations, while more cunning practitioners have used it for offensive purposes.

Unlike other forms of Mana, Grace consumes less from its wielder, allowing one to channel it longer than other mana. Those that weaponize it do so through disrupting others' mana: using Grace as a poison while relying on brute force or precise strikes for damage.

There is one major drawback however. Grace revolves around goodwill and selfless pursuits. If one strays too far from these ideals, the mana will cease and some other mana; usually Sin, will appear instead. Wielding Grace isn't just a choice, it's a lifestyle.

Furthermore, Grace bestows no other strength. Blows powered by Grace are no stronger than without. If anything, Grace ensures that an attack doesn't kill. Though it does a good job at bolstering one's endurance, it is not a mana wielded by those who wish to become stronger but to protect those they care about. Therefore the mana is rare, even amongst those who claim to stand for justice.

There is little that isn't inherently evil about Malice. It is a variant of mana that has been distorted and twisted by selfishness and a lust for control. Most of the evil connotations surrounding Sin aren't based around the mana itself, but the potential for it to morph into Malice.

The techniques and ambitions fueled by Malice seek not just to destroy one's enemy, but to dominate and torment. Whilst one who channels other types of mana would focus on victory, Malice's wielder would wish to strike fear, pain, and despair into their foes. The more pain one inflicts, the stronger Malice becomes.

It's rare for someone to wield Malice by accident. It might start out as simple pursuit, such as vengeance, with their intent become more malevolent and selfish. Trauma, strife, and injustices are the prime contributors to Malice's use. Sometimes people wield Malice as a boon from a devil's contract, and the fiend-blooded Dretchlings have an innate attraction to the wicked mana. The pitiful race often falls to Malice not because of their birthright, but because of the people that fear and despise them.

Malice comes from the plane of Hell. The devils that hail from there are beings of Malice. To them, funneling the mana is second nature; unlike mortals who claim they can contain it. Malice, despite it's immediate power, demands a lot from its wielder mentally. On top of the side effects from burnout, overuse of Malice usually leads people into insanity. Only devils are immune from this effect, and even they are careful not to let this fiendish effigy control them.

While people who channel Malice have evil intent, that isn't to say that they can't fit into society. Malice might not be directed at the world, just a portion of it. Those who channel Malice can still love others, have friends, and have a moral compass. But what makes them use Malice is the ruthless endeavors they're willing to undertake to achieve their goals, caring not for anyone's well-being but themselves. Some mortals flock to the mana as a test of their character even, albeit a rash decision... It is believed that our darkest desires stem from Malice, and like the monsters that are born from it, it is not to be treated lightly.

When one thinks of an archfiend, the last thing they consider is a woman of virtue. Lady Hecate embodies many aspects of desire. From a beautiful woman, to security of one's family, and to the beauty of children, all symbolize the archfiend's grace.

Hecate is a dangerous archfiend. She does not bind mortals through temptation, coercion, or seduction. Rather, she is simply present. Many turn to Yeshua for guidance and find nothing more than vagueness and uncertainty, the task being for them to answer as he supposedly guides the mortal to their solution. Hecate is no such being. She is notorious for answering calls more than any archfiend. Whether through her agents, or the destruction of one's enemies, she includes herself into the lives of her followers. But with a price.

Like any devil, Hecate asks for the signing of pacts. Unlike other devils, it is not her pacts that bind the soul but the devotion that leads the soul to her. Hecate's deals are fair and vague only in extremities. In tandem with their request, the mortal will find themselves with more than they bargained for. The succubi and incubi that serve her often become evangelizers to the mortal, slowly indoctrinating them into her flock through their wisdom and their reliability. Eventually the mortal views her as their patron, and follow her decrees blindly despite how bloody they might be. For Mother knows best, and those that spited her will spite anyone else they come by.

Hecate is a benevolent archfiend, but also holds the domain of vengeance. It is true that all archfiends are monsters. They'd gladly conquer Eldermyst had it not been for the Tu'uns and Archons that defend it, but Hecate fears no one. She does not ravage the lands of transgressor. She prefers irony and inflicting despair as one's greatest wish is twisted against them. They say that when rosebushes surround an area, Hecate's wrath is near. And many conquerors, soldiers, or even defenders refuse to attack children or their mothers because doing so is believed to summon the end of your existence.
