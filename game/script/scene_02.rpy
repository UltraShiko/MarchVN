    "A choir of crickets chirps as we leave Jubilee's outskirts."
    "I feel dismayed. The moon's radiance is telling me it’s time for bed, but we’ve only just started our journey..."
    extend " Meanwhile, Griswyr moves like he’s in his element, under the cover of night..."
    "Now that I think about it, something is...different about him."
    extend " He can’t be a Dretchling. They’re pale, but not to his degree. And his eyes don’t share their crimson pupils."
    "Yet the way he carries himself, feels unnatural somehow."
    extend " He looks human, but..."

    nvl clear

    g "You aren't getting tired already, are you?"

    c "N-No! I'm just...usually in bed by this time."

    g "You'll wake up soon enough. Their cave isn't far from here."

    c "R-Right!"
    extend " So, can you tell me about these uhh, \"Thorns\"?"

    g "...It's a band of heretics worshiping an Archfiend? What more do you need to know?"

    c "I mean, their numbers? Their weapons? If there's anyone among them who can cast spells or utilize mana?"

    g "Hmm, I wasn't expecting you to be so resourceful."
    extend " It's a small sect. I doubt there's more than ten of them. I'd also expect their leader to wield magic."

    c "Ah! I was expecting something more organized! That eases my mind!"

    g "And they're on the cusp of summoning a devil."

    c "..."
    extend "Tonight?"

    g "Tonight."
    g "If one pops out, this mission becomes much deadlier. Even I will have to be careful.."
    extend " Not like it'd change the outcome, of course."

    c "Hmm..."

    g "I wouldn't have picked someone who was incapable. I have high expectations for you, and I’m determined to see them met."
    extend " I don't think I need to explain the consequences of a devil escaping..."

    c "O-Of course not. Not like I'd let them finish summoning it."

    g "How do you intend to stop it?"

    c "Well, if we move together, we can dispatch them easily one-by-one."
    extend " I assume this ritual requires a lot of mana. The fewer men they have, the more mana will be needed from each of them."

    g "And you don't think their leader has it in spades? He's devout, after all. His fervor alone is likely all that's needed."

    c "Well then, we can sneak in, take him out, and-"

    g "Are you so quick to abandon your plans?"

    c "But you said-"

    g "So what? One weak point doesn't make a plan fallible."
    extend " If anything, your next suggestion may as well be suicide. What cult would be foolish enough to allow us to assassinate their leader?"
    g "These people are aware of the danger; from us, from rival cults, and from the wrath of their deity."
    extend " If anything, they already know we're coming. Hecate's followers are excellent at blending in..."

    c "If I recall correctly, Hecate favors deception. I've heard that even beggars worship her in secret."

    g "Why do you think we have Celestials guarding every orphanage? They're breeding grounds for her acolytes. No one ever suspects caregivers."
    g "I was lucky to locate this cult. Normally they are just as elusive as succubi, but I guess someone got sloppy. Or confident..."

    c "Alright, then let's discuss tactics."
    extend " I'm good at fighting hand-to-hand, and I have great control of my mana."

    g "You, a fighter? With arms that spindly?"

    c "Yes..."

    "I made a mistake years ago, so I took a vow of poverty."
    extend " Part of keeping that vow has been limiting my nutrition and activity. I will remain in this state until I redeem myself."

    g "How pious..."
    extend " Too pious! You expect such flimsy arms to have an impact?"

    c "That's what my mana is for."

    g "What mana do you wield?"

    c "Grace."
    extend " Normally it doesn't empower its wielder like other mana, but I've learned to manipulate it to my advantage."
    c "And if this devil emerges, she’ll be weak in the face of it."
    extend " Devils are beings of the dark mana, Malice. Seeing how Grace repels that mana, I'm certain even my jabs will be lethal to it."

    g "They might, assuming you get the chance to use it."

    c "Well as you said, I am feeble. I doubt the monster will expect much of a fight from me."

    g "Or, it'd take you out first to even the odds."
    extend " Let's say it barrels towards you, wanting to kill you as quickly as possible. What then?"

    c "..."
    extend "Then I'll-"

    g "Too late, you're dead."
    extend " You hesitated, and it tore your throat out."

    c "Oh..."

    g "You don't hesitate. Not for a second. If it targets you, you fight back."
    extend " If it chases after me, you pursue it. If it casts a spell, you dodge. Whatever happens, you adapt."
    g "I can tell that you spend way too much time thinking, and not enough time acting..."
    extend " On a good day, the best plans fail. We're dealing with schemers from Hell itself, what makes you think that you can outwit them?"

    c "..."

    g "Humor me. Why do you think I picked you?"

    c "Hmm, I was wondering that myself..."

    g "Two reasons."
    extend " One, for your mana. If this monster is summoned, I'll need an support. I don't channel Grace, nor do I plan on discovering a source of it for myself."

    c "So you knew all along?"

    g "Of course I did."
    extend " I know who you are, your abilities, your nature, and more importantly, your origins."

    c "That means...you know I'm from Thrycia."

    g "I also know about your run-in with the law."

    "I gasp."
    extend " I should've expected no less from an Emmisary... Why wouldn't they research their applicants?"
    "Though I had hoped that the reverend and Jory had kept what happened a secret amongst themselves..."

    c "...How much do you know?"

    g "Enough."
    extend " I know about the Dretchling, and I know about the dead Celestial."
    extend " I also understand that you and the Dretchling were cutpurses at one point."

    c "...We were."
    extend " You don't have...plans to arrest my friend, do you?"

    g "That decision is not mine to make."
    extend " I've partnered with murderers, arsonists, champions of Yeshua, fallen champions, it makes no difference to me."
    g "I only care about results."
    extend " Morals mean nothing in the grand scheme of things. If Yeshua felt so obliged, he would get off his lofty throne and solve everything himself."
    g "But he doesn't, so his opinion means nothing to me. If principles give you faith, so be it. As long as the mission is accomplished, I don't care."

    c "That's..."
    extend "cold."

    g "Consider it a taste of being an Emmisary."
    extend " We aren't heroes, Caius. We're exterminators."
    extend " Those Celestials, or Luminaries as we call them, only serve to assuage the public."
    g "The Celestials that truly care about defending our country join our ranks. Anyone else is just a pretender."

    c "I believe you had a second reason for picking me?"

    "He snarls softly but quickly recovers his stoicism."

    g "Indeed... I picked you because I believe you are driven by regret."
    g "I'm not a fan of the \"righteous crusaders\", or anyone with a savior complex. They may as well be infants."

    "The more he belittles others, the uneasier I grow."
    extend " He's very condescending... I understand that his work is treacherous, yet I can’t imagine myself ever becoming so cynical."
    "Is this attitude what Jory meant by life as an Emmisary \"breaking\" people?"

    c "...With all due respect sir, you are very judgemental."

    g "And?"

    c "What's wrong with wanting to protect other people? Would you prefer people to join for money alone?"

    g "Yes, it's a realistic and achievable goal."

    c "Well, I hate to upset you, but my motivation isn't too far off from the former."
    extend " Regret is a big part of it, but I want to reform the empire into something more."
    c "That Dretchling and Jory were victims of oppression."
    extend " I used to be a cutthroat, but I had a choice. My friend, well...no one would pay a \"mongrel\" to shine their shoes."

    g "Fear – it drives the weak. How unfortunate for him."

    "Hmm, Griswyr still remains unfazed."
    extend " Whenever I bring up my friend being a Dretchling, people always scowl, grimace, or become disgusted. I figured an Emmisary would react no differently..."
    "Then again, Griswyr doesn’t strike me as normal either."

    g "It's a pious goal, but at least it has direction."

    c "Sir, I must know..."
    extend " Are you human?"

    "He blinks at me, as if I’m asking him for the color of the sky."

    g "...What makes you think otherwise?"

    c "I-I don't mean to be rude-"

    g "Save it. It's not the first time I've been asked that."
    extend " Let's just say a whimsical creature thought it'd be humorous to mangle with my soul when I was a child. The end."

    "He doesn’t appear insulted, though that response seems rehearsed."
    extend " Not like it changes the way I see him. Though he’s definitely growing \"more alive\" with power, the darker it gets."

    g "Enough questions, we're almost there."
