    extend " Meanwhile, Griswyr moves like he's in his element, under the cover of night..."
    "Now that I think about it, something is...different about him."
    extend " He can't be a Dretchling. They're pale, but not to his degree. And his eyes donâ€™t share their crimson pupils."
    "Yet the way he carries himself, feels unnatural somehow."
    extend " He looks human, but..."

    g "You aren't getting tired already, are you?"

    c "N-No! I'm just...usually in bed by this time."

    g "You'll wake up soon enough. Their cave isn't far from here."

    c angry "R-Right!"
    extend " So, can you tell me about these uhh, \"Thorns\"?"

    g "...It's a band of heretics worshiping an Archfiend. What more do you need to know?"

    c neutral "I mean, their numbers? Their weapons? If there's anyone among them who can cast spells or utilize mana?"

    g "Hmm, I wasn't expecting you to be so resourceful."
    extend " It's a small sect. I doubt there's more than ten of them. I'd imagine their leader can wield magic."

    c smile "Ah! I was expecting something more organized! That eases my mind!"

    g "And they're on the cusp of summoning a devil."

    c neutral "..."
    extend "Tonight?"

    g "Tonight."
    g "If one pops out, this mission becomes much deadlier. Even I will have to be careful.."
    extend " Not like it'll change the outcome, of course."

    c neutral "Hmm..."

    g "I wouldn't have picked someone who was incapable. I have high expectations for you, and I expect to see them met."
    extend " I don't think I need to explain the consequences of a devil escaping."

    c angry "O-Of course not. Not like I'd let them finish summoning it."

    g "How do you intend to stop it?"

    c neutral "Well, if we move together, we can dispatch them  one-by-one."
    extend " I assume this ritual requires a lot of mana. The fewer men they have, the more mana will be needed from each of them."

    g "And you don't think their leader has mana in spades? He's devout, after all. His fervor alone is likely all that's needed."

    c neutral "Well then, we can sneak in, take him out, and-"

    g "Are you so quick to abandon your plans?"

    c snide "But you said-"

    g "So what? One weak point doesn't make a plan fallible."
    extend " If anything, your next suggestion may as well be suicide. What cult would be foolish enough to allow us to assassinate their leader?"
    g "These people are aware of the danger; from us, from rival cults, and from the wrath of their deity."
    extend " If anything, they already know we're coming. Hecate's followers are excellent at blending in."

    c neutral "If I recall correctly, Hecate favors deception. I've heard that even beggars worship her in secret."

    g "Why do you think we have Celestials guarding every orphanage? They're breeding grounds for her acolytes. No one ever suspects caregivers."
    g "I was lucky to locate this cult. Normally they are just as elusive as succubi, but I guess someone got sloppy. Or arrogant."

    c neutral "Alright, then let's discuss tactics."
    extend " I'm good at fighting hand-to-hand, and I have great control of my mana."

    g "You, a fighter? With arms that spindly?"

    c "Yes..."

    "I took a vow of poverty to atone for what I said to my friend."
    extend " I chose to live in poverty, much like he and I were living in before the incident."
    #$ unlockCompendionEntry("CircleLore")
    "It would've been very easy for me to establish a comfortable life. Had I joined the Celestials, I've could've bought a house in the Enlighted Circle."
    "But I wouldn't be able to forgive myself. My friend shouldn't continue to starve while I enjoy myself. Especially when my mistake got me where I am."
    extend " I'm no snake. I'm grateful for where I am, but I will indulge myself once I've changed how Dretchlings are treated."
    "This vow limits my nutrition and spending activities. I only eat enough to sustain myself, and purchase items that are absolutely necessary."
    extend " Jory believes I would have been taller had I eaten a normal diet. But I care little about my appearance."
    "Besides, this vow has forced me to look within myself, to master every thought that passes through."
    extend " And it has made me stronger!"

    # nvl clear

    g "How pious..."
    extend " Too pious! You expect such flimsy arms to have an impact?"

    c smile "That's what my mana is for."

    g "What mana do you wield?"

    $ unlockCompendionEntry("GraceLore")
    c "Grace."
    extend " Normally it doesn't empower its wielder like other mana, but I've learned to manipulate it to my advantage."
    c smile "Grace will be paramount if this monster is summoned."
    $ unlockCompendionEntry("MaliceLore")
    extend " Devils are beings of the dark mana, Malice. Seeing how Grace repels that mana, I'm certain even my jabs will be lethal to it."

    g "It might, assuming you get the chance to use it."

    c "Well as you said, I am feeble. I doubt the fiend will expect much of a fight from me."

    g "Or, it'd take you out first to even the odds."
    extend " Let's say it barrels towards you, wanting to kill you as quickly as possible. What then?"

    c "..."
    extend "Then I'll-"

    g "Too late, you're dead!"
    extend " You hesitated, and it tore your throat out."

    c snide "Oh..."

    g "You don't hesitate. Not for a second. If it attacks, you fight back."
    extend " If it chases after me, you pursue it. If it casts a spell, you dodge. Whatever happens, you adapt!"
    g "I can tell that you spend way too much time thinking, and not enough time acting."
    extend " On a good day, the best plans fail. We're dealing with schemers from Hell itself, what makes you think that you can outwit them?"

    c snide "..."

    g "Humor me. Why do you think I picked you?"

    c "Hmm, I was wondering that myself..."

    g "Two reasons."
    extend " One, for your mana. If this monster is summoned, I need someone to exploit its weakness. I don't channel Grace, nor do I plan on it."

    c snide "So you knew all along?"

    g "Of course I did."
    extend " I know who you are, your abilities, your nature, and more importantly, your origins."

    $ unlockCompendionEntry("ThryciaLore")
    c snide "That means...you know I'm from Thrycia."

    g "I also know about your run-in with the law."

    "I gasp."
    extend " I should've expected no less from an Emissary... Why wouldn't they research their applicants?"
    "Though I had hoped that the reverend and Jory had kept what happened a secret amongst themselves..."

    # nvl clear

    c snide "...How much do you know?"

    g "Enough."
    extend " I know about the Dretchling, and I know about the dead Celestial."
    extend " I also understand that you and the Dretchling were cutpurses at one point."

    c snide "...We were."
    extend " You don't have...plans to arrest my friend, do you?"

    g "That decision is not mine to make."
    extend " I've partnered with murderers, arsonists, champions of Yeshua, fallen champions, it makes no difference to me."
    g "I only care about results."
    extend " Morals mean nothing in the grand scheme of things. If Yeshua felt so obliged, he would get off his lofty throne and solve everything himself."
    g "But he doesn't, so his opinion means nothing to me."
    extend " If principles give you faith, so be it. As long as the mission is accomplished, I don't care."

    c "That's..."
    extend "cold."

    g "Consider it a taste of being an Emissary."
    extend " We aren't heroes, Caius. We're exterminators."
    extend " Those Celestials, or Luminaries as we call them, only serve to assuage the public."
    g "The Celestials that truly care about defending our country join our ranks. Anyone else is just a pretender."

    c "I believe you had a second reason for picking me?"

    "He snarls softly, but quickly recovers his stoicism."

    # nvl clear

    g "Indeed. I picked you because I believe you are driven by regret."
    g "I'm not a fan of the \"righteous crusaders\", or anyone with a savior complex. They may as well be infants."

    "The more he belittles others, the uneasier I grow."
    extend " He's very condescending... I understand that his work is treacherous, yet I can't imagine myself ever becoming so cynical."
    "Is this attitude what Jory meant by the life as an Emissary \"breaking\" people?"

    # nvl clear

    c angry "...With all due respect sir, you are very judgemental."

    g "And?"

    c angry "What's wrong with wanting to protect other people? Would you prefer people to join for money alone?"

    g "Yes, it's a realistic and achievable goal."

    c angry "Well, I hate to upset you, but my motivation isn't too far off from the former."
    extend " Regret is a big part of it, but I want to reform our country into something better."
    c angry "That Dretchling and Jory were victims of oppression."
    extend " I used to be a cutthroat, but I had a choice. My friend...no one would pay a \"mongrel\" to shine their shoes."

    g "Fear - it drives the weak. How unfortunate for him."

    "Hmm, Griswyr still remains unfazed."
    extend " Whenever I bring up my friend being a Dretchling, people always scowl, grimace, or become disgusted. I figured an Emissary would react no differently..."
    "Then again, Griswyr doesn't strike me as normal either."

    # nvl clear

    g "It's a pious goal, but at least it has direction."

    c "Sir, I must know..."
    extend " Are you human?"

    "He blinks at me, as if I'm asking him if the sky was blue."

    # nvl clear

    g "...What makes you think otherwise?"

    c snide "I-I don't mean to be rude-"

    g "Save it. It's not the first time I've been asked that."
    extend " Let's just say a whimsical creature thought it'd be humorous to mangle with my soul when I was a child. The end."

    "He doesn't appear insulted, though that response seems rehearsed."
    extend " Not like it changes the way I see him. Though he's definitely growing \"more alive\", the darker it gets."
    "Griswy wasn't this outspoken when we met. I can understand being a night owl, but it's like the night is his element."
    extend " Though if he sleeps during the day, I guess it makes sense. Much like how I'm an early riser, and rely on the sun to keep me going."

    # nvl clear

    g "Enough questions, we're almost there."
