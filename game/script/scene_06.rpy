    v "By Yeshua, I knew I shouldn't have let him leave!"
    v "Enough. He needs rest. Any more of your healing will accomplish nothing.."
    v "Damn you, Emissary!"
    v "I'll accept your insults. I should be dead myself. I would prefer it to the position we're in now..."
    v "Oh! He's waking up! Thank goodness!"

    "My body stirs wearily, wrapped in bandages in more places than I can fathom..."
    "I find myself in Jory's arms... It still hurts to move, but it looks like I’ve pulled through."
    "Griswyr stands in the corner, at a distant as always."

    j "By Yeshua, are you alright?!"

    c "Ngh....well, I’m still breathing so..."

    g "Luckily most of his injuries weren't deep. Those broken ribs are going to need some time, not like you can move anyways."
    g "You're nearly burnt all of your mana, Caius. A drop more, and you would be a corpse."

    j "It shouldn't have ended this way!"
    j "What came of this?! All you did was put my friend in bandages! You didn't even kill the devil!"

    g "I know, and I'm very upset... She's going to be a problem."
    extend " Caius was the only reason we lived. This won't make you feel better, but I believe he'll make a fine Emissary."
    g "If he wants to, that is."

    "Jory's fist slams onto a table and causes the ground to quake!"
    "I know he didn't mean to, but damn that hurts my ribs..."
    extend " Of course Griswyr hardly cares..."

    j "Get out! Our business is done!"

    g "As you wish. It's not our decision to make, it's his."
    extend " I'll find you once you're ready to decide. I won't blame you if you want to reconsider joining after last night."
    g " Until next time."

    j "Grr... Damn it! I gave the reverend my word I wouldn't let this happen..."

    c "Hey...it's not your fault, sir."
    extend " I couldn't stop thinking about you... I kept pushing myself for your sake..."

    j "Oh right, you made that promise..."
    extend " But I'm not the one who needs to be protected!"

    c "On that, we'll have to agree to disagree..."

    j "By Yeshua, you're as stubborn as always..."

    c "Hey Jory, when I'm better..."
    extend " Can we visit Thrycia?"

    j "I...thought you wanted to become an Emissary first."

    c "I did, but after last night, I'm ready to go back now,"
    extend " I may not be able to change anything yet, but I can still see him..."

    "Jory sighs deeply and closes his eyes."

    j "Caius...there's something you need to know."
    extend " While you were gone, word hit Jubilee, and..."
    c "And...?"

    "He gulps hard and speaks slowly."

    j "Thrycia..."
    extend "is no more."

    c "Huh...?"

    j "No one is sure of what happened, but the rumors say a devil was involved..."

    c "A devil...?!"

    j "Two... Apparently, a dretchling summoned it. I'm sorry..."

    c "Gngh!" with vpunch

    "I swear I hear Persephone's words in my mind again."

    p "Don't worry, I'll leave Jory be, just as you wished. Anything to get away from you..."

    "My mouth falls agape. I stare at Jory in utter denial."
    "My heart races, tears fall from my cheeks, but all I can do is remain paralyzed in shock..."
    "Yet again, I was too weak...and now."
    extend " There's nothing I can do to save him...!"

    c "...Priam?!"
